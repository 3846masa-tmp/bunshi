At it's core Bunshi is a dependency injection framework, not a state management framework. It was designed to be complimentary to the ecosystem of state management tools and frontend frameworks.

## Bunshi vs Jotai

[Jotai](https://jotai.org/) takes an atomic approach to state management.

Molecules are similar to and inspired by Jotai atoms, but with a few important differences:

- **Molecules can't be async**, but atoms can be.
- **Molecules are read-only**, but atoms can be writable.
- **Molecules aren't reactive**, but you can subscribe to and listen to an atom.

Jotai and Bunshi both share the concept of "scope", but they are very different.

- **Molecule scopes can be interconnected**, but atom scopes are "separate universes".
- **Molecules can depend on molecules AND scope**, but atoms only depend on other atoms.
- You are unlikely to ever use Jotai scope, but you should definitely use Bunshi scope as much as possible.

## Bunshi vs TSyringe

[TSyringe](https://github.com/microsoft/tsyringe) is a lightweight dependency injection container for TypeScript/JavaScript.

Molecules in Bunshi are similar to Providers in TSyringe and accomplish a similar goal to dependency injection.

Pros for Bunshi:

- Bunshi has scoping
- Bunshi has React and Vue support
- Bunshi doesn't rely on decorators. It is hard to use `reflect-metadata` with starters like CRA, Next.js etc. You need to eject or hack starters and it is far from ideal.
- Bunshi doesn't automatically handle classes

Pros for TSyringe:

- Support constructor injection on classes with decorators
- Disposable instances
- Circular dependencies
- Interception
