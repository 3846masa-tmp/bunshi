## Installation

Bunshi is distributed on NPM as both a CommonJS and ES Module. It supports both Javscript and Typescript.

```sh
npm i -D bunshi
```

## Create a Molecule

Molecules are the core building block of bunshi. They are functions that return a value. Use molecules when you want to create a stable
object to share with the rest of your application. For this example, a `jotai` atom.

```ts
import { molecule } from "bunshi";
import { atom } from "jotai/vanilla";

export const CountMolecule = molecule(() => atom(0));
```

> When this `CountMolecule` is used it will always return the same `atom`. The value is memoized and cached.

## Use a Molecule

To use a molecule, pass it to `useMolecule` in your framework integration (React or Vue). An instance of `atom` will be automatically created once and shared across the application in every call to `useMolecule`.

        "jotai-vue": "^0.1",
      }}

    />
  </TabItem>

## Scope a Molecule

Molecules can be [scoped](/concepts/scopes). Scoped molecules provide a single value per scope, instead of a single value globally.
In the above example the `atom` was shared globally across the app. Instead, let's make each component have it's own state
using the built-in `ComponentScope`.

```ts
import { ComponentScope, molecule } from "bunshi";
import { atom } from "jotai/vanilla";

export const CountMolecule = molecule((_, scope) => {
  // Because `scope` was called here, this molecule is component scoped
  scope(ComponentScope);
  return atom(0);
});
```

Scoping is declarative. By calling `scope(ComponentScope)` the molecule will automatically be scoped.

      dependencies={{

        "jotai-vue": "^0.1",
      }}
      template="vite-vue"
    />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

> Important: See how the source for `Counter` didn't change? This shows how Bunshi lets you pull state up, or
> push state down. No component changes needed, only molecule changes.

## Use a custom scope

Sometimes state needs to be shared, not globally or per-component, but somewhere in the middle like a Form. Bunshi has `createScope` for this.
There are a lot of use cases for [scopes](/concepts/scopes) for sharing data across pages, sections, forms, or even rows or columns in a table.

Here let's share our state for all counters in the same form.

```ts
import { createScope, molecule } from "bunshi";
import { atom } from "jotai/vanilla";

// FormScope will be used for provided a string value to forms
export const FormScope = createScope("none");

export const CountMolecule = molecule((_, scope) => {
  // Since `scope` is called here, it makes `CountMolecule` scoped to the form
  scope(FormScope);
  return atom(0);
});
```

## Provide a custom scope

Custom scopes need to be provided using the framework-specific API. Bunshi comes with integrations into React and Vue to provide scope implicitly.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="React">
    For React use a `ScopeProvider` as a wrapping component, and all children can implicitly use that scope.
    <CodeEditor
      files={{
        "App.tsx": quickstart.ReactFormApp,
        "molecules.ts": quickstart.molecules3,
      }}
      dependencies={{
        jotai: "^2.5",
      }}
    />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Vue">
    For Vue use `provideScope` to provide scope implicitly to all children in the `slot`.
    <CodeEditor
      files={{
        "src/App.vue": quickstart.VueFormApp,
        "src/Counter.vue": quickstart.VueCounter,
        "src/Form.vue": quickstart.VueForm,
        "src/molecules.ts": quickstart.molecules3,
      }}
      dependencies={{
        jotai: "^2.5",
        "jotai-vue": "^0.1",
      }}
      template="vite-vue"
    />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

In this example everything inside of the `<Form>` component will be share an `atom`, it won't be unique per component
or shared across the entire application.

## Conclusion - Decoupled and Lazy

The code that you wrote is decoupled and lazy.

- **Decoupled**: You can refactor the `CountMolecule` without affecting the thing that depend on it.
- **Lazy**: An atom is only created lazily when it's needed. It's not eagerly created and sitting around in a variable.

When your write code with molecules, you can pull state up or push state down, without having to refactor your components.

We completed an example of scoping the `atom` to be global, scoped to a component, or shared inside of a form.
