# Bunshi (formerly `jotai-molecules`)

> Bunshi (分子 / ぶんし) - Japanese for molecule, member or element.

A tiny, fast, dependency-free 1.18kb library for creating states stores and other dependencies that lets you lift state up or push state down. Works out of the box with React, Vue and vanilla javascript and Typescript.

Works well with state solutions like:

- [jotai](https://jotai.org/) atoms
- [valtio](https://valtio.pmnd.rs/) proxies
- [zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/) stores
- [nanostores](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores)
- [vue reactive](https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/state-management.html#simple-state-management-with-reactivity-api)

See [Motivation](#motivation) for more details on why we created this library. Inspired by [jotai](https://jotai.org/) and [guice](https://github.com/google/guice).
